# electrotupah
A basic DIY drumset. 
This project was started by @[AngelLM](https://github.com/AngelLM) and improved versions by UC3Music members.

## Hardware

### Structure
The structure consists of PVC pipes.

### Pads
The pad structure has been 3D-printed using the model avaiable at the [open e-drums](https://open-e-drums.com/) page. The mesh heads are Millenium (8" for toms and 10" for the snare drum).

### Bass drum pedal
We are using a modified pedal that kicks downwards. It is attached to a 3D-printed piece that contains the piezoelectric element.

### Drum module
At the moment, we are using the Alesis D4 drum module, but we expect to use a DIY and open source one in the future.
